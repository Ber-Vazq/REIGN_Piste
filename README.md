# REIGN_Piste
 Final Project for gamedev

please download the Reign_Piste.zip.

after you should be able to press the Reign_Piste application file type, it'll bring up a prompt with windows defender (or not depends on you)

then press run anyways/extract, and you should be able to run after pressing the Reign Piste application

the icon should be the basic fencer.

BUGS

there is a chance that upon entering the game scene where the characters don't move. you just have to press the pause button then resume and it'll work fine.
